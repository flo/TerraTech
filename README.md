## Terra Tech

### Getting started
Currently there is no world generation,  so trying out new things requires getting a starter pack of items.
Open the console window and type terraTechStarterPack.  This will give you some basic items to try.

### Iron Works
Your hearth needs to be heated in order to melt iron.  Put coal into a fireplace next to your herath. Iron melts at 1538 degrees.

A piece of bloom is a nugget of iron with impurities solidified around it. Use an anvil and a hammer to get your iron nugget.
