## Terra Tech

### Getting started
Currently there is no world generation,  so trying out new things requires getting a starter pack of items.
Open the command window with [tab] and type terraTechStarterPack.  This will give you some basic items to try.

### Iron Works
Your bloomery needs to be heated.  Put coal into your firebox to heat the bloomery above it. Iron melts at 1538 degrees.

A piece of bloom is a nugget of iron with impurities solidified around it. Use an anvil and a hammer to get your iron nugget.
