## Terra Tech

### Demo
You can use the in game command terraTechStarterPack to get some basic items to try.

Supplying no parameter gives everything.  Or,  you can specify a specific pack of items: IronWorks, ItemConveyors, MechanicalPower, or Magic.

### Iron Works
Your hearth needs to be heated in order to melt iron.  Put coal into a fireplace next to your herath. Iron melts at 1538 degrees.

A piece of bloom is a nugget of iron with impurities solidified around it. Use an anvil and a hammer to get your iron nugget.
